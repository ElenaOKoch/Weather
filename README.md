<h3>You can identify weather in different places of the world with thiss app. </h3>
  <h4>It includes:<br> 
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white" width="100"/> <br> 
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E" width="100"/></h4>
<p align="justify">I hope to improve design and the add ability to display not only the weather for today, but also receive information about what the day was like on a certain date in the past.
